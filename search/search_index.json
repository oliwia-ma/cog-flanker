To do so, I made a quick audio test using jsPsych. You can first try the test by clicking HERE . I put the working codes into the Mood Induction repository . You can either directly use these files or fork this repository to customize. This tutorial consists of two parts. (1) I will first explain how you can embed the Audio Test in Qualtrics . (2) I will then explain the experiment code . Embedding the Quick Audio Test into Qualtrics Hosting the Quick Audio Test scripts in GitHub To use jsPsych in Qualtrics, the jsPsych javascript and CSS files need to be online and loadable from Qualtrics. Creating a GitHub repository for your experiment helps you do so in simple steps. Go to the Mood Induction repository . Follow the Hosting jsPsych tutorial to fork it to your GitHub repository and make the scripts available online. Also make sure that sound files play on your browser. When you are done, you can check the online files with your browser by directly going to the jspsych.js , jspsych.css , jspsych-fullscreen.js , and jspsych-audio-keyboard-with-replay.js . jspsych.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js . jspsych.css should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css . jspsych-fullscreen.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-fullscreen.js , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-fullscreen.js . jspsych-audio-keyboard-with-replay.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-audio-keyboard-with-replay.js , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-audio-keyboard-with-replay.js . Sound files are stored in the audiotest folder and should be available online, like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/audiotest/c.mp3 . Embedding the task to Qualtrics Let's log in to Qualtrics and take a look at each step. Step 1. Create a new Qualtrics project and then a new question This tutorial assumes that readers are much more familiar with Qualtrics. For Qualtrics tutorial, there are other excellent tutorials available like this Qualtrics User Guide . To continue, please create a new Qualtrics project. Then, create a new question and (1) change its format to Text/Graphic . Step 2. Open the Question JavaScript editor and copy paste the whole audio-test-qualtrics.js Keep going in the above picture. (2) Click the gear to open the dropdown menu, and then (3) find and click Add JavaScript . Then copy-paste the whole audio-test-qualtrics.js (click to see the code) into the editor. ALSO CHECK WHETHER THE URLs ARE VALID. For example, task_github and audio_url . Step 3. Open the Question HTML editor and copy paste the below html code The Change 3 section of the audio-test-demo.html file contains the link to jsPsych CSS file, the inline styles for display_stage Div, and the error message to be displayed when things go wrong. To open the HTML editor, click the HTML View button. Then, copy paste the portion of audio-test-demo.html to the HTML editor, starting from <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> to <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> . <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"> <b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } #centerbox { width: 80vw; height: 30vh; position: relative; top: 40%; font-size: 20pt; line-height: normal; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> After copy pasting, you should see something like below. Step 4. Create Embedded Data elements To store the addition details about this audio test, you need to create the Embedded Data elements named audio_test_rt and audio_test_order in your survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Click Survey Flow from the Survey tab Click Add a New Element Here Choose Embedded Data Click Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown and type audio_test_rt Click Add a New Field and type audio_test_order Click Move of the new blocks you created ( Set Embedded Data and Then Branch If ) and move these blocks the top of Survey Flow Step 5. Publish and test! Publish the survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Then, an anonymous Qualtrics link is generated. If you click this link, you should be able to see the same Audio Test running in Qualtrics. For example, try this Qualtrics link . Explaining the code For the basics, please read the Hello world tutorial . A working demo in a local browser: audio-test-demo.html Adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() and having additional control over the display element is important for embedding jsPsych into Qualtrics. The changes in audio-test-demo.html (click to see the code) are in the same order as in the Hello world tutorial . You should be able to run the audio test simply by opening audio-test-demo.html in a browser. Let's look at each change. Change 1: Using display_element By adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() like below, jsPsych will render the experiment in the <div> called display_stage , which the current script does not have yet. So, let's add the display_stage . /* Change 1: Using `display_element` */ jsPsych.init({ timeline: timeline, display_element: 'display_stage' }) Change 2: Adding display_stage CSS and Div The display_stage needs below CSS and HTML code after the <body> tag, which also include the display_stage_background . Both are necessary to function well. The centerbox is where we put the text prompts. <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } #centerbox { width: 80vw; height: 30vh; position: relative; top: 40%; font-size: 20pt; line-height: normal; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> <div id='display_stage_background'></div> <div id='display_stage'></div> Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics The below scripts are not necessary to run this task, but you need to copy-paste these in Qualtrics later. One critical point is that now we use the jsPsych stylesheet hosted in the GitHub Pages (explained above in the Hosting jsPsych section) instead of the CSS file in your computer. This is important because Qualtrics can also access the GitHub-hosted files. <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"> <b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> Qualtrics transformation: audio-test-qualtrics.js To make your jsPsych experiment work in Qualtrics, you need to add your code to the below skeleton provided by Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. For details, see the Add JavaScript help page . Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page loads*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is fully displayed*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is unloaded*/ }); Let's look at each change. Change 1: Hiding the Next button The below javascript code hides the Next button and puts the javascript code in the driving seat. /* Change 1: Hiding the Next button */ // Retrieve Qualtrics object and save in qthis var qthis = this; // Hide buttons qthis.hideNextButton(); Change 2: Defining and load required resources The below javascript defines where the necessary files are so that Qualtrics can load these. If you enabled GitHub Pages of your repository, Qualtrics can load the necessary JS, CSS, and image files right away. /* Change 2: Defining and load required resources */ // task-related variables var audio_test_rt = []; var audio_test_order = []; // requiredResources must include all the required JS files var task_github = \"https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/\"; // https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name> var requiredResources = [ task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\", task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-fullscreen.js\", task_github + \"jspsych-audio-keyboard-with-replay.js\" ]; function loadScript(idx) { console.log(\"Loading \", requiredResources[idx]); jQuery.getScript(requiredResources[idx], function () { if ((idx + 1) < requiredResources.length) { loadScript(idx + 1); } else { initExp(); } }); } if (window.Qualtrics && (!window.frameElement || window.frameElement.id !== \"mobile-preview-view\")) { loadScript(0); } Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery In Qualtrics, jQuery (loaded by default) is used to append the display_stage_background and display_stage Divs. The CSS for these elements will be added directly to Question HTML later in this tutorial. /* Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery */ // jQuery is loaded in Qualtrics by default jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage_background'></div>\").appendTo('body'); jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage'></div>\").appendTo('body'); Change 4: Adding resources, scripts, and helper functions /* Change 4: Adding resouces, scripts, and helper functions */ var audio_url = 'https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/audiotest/'; var audio_seed = ['c', 'd', 'g', 'k', 'p', 'q', 't']; // WARNING: YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE THE OUTPUT URLS ARE CORRECT function get_audio_url(audio_url, file_name, file_ext = 'mp3') { return audio_url + file_name + '.' + file_ext; } // generate audiotest trials function generate_audiotest_block(audio_url, audio_seed) { audio_test_order = jsPsych.randomization.shuffle(audio_seed); let block_audiotest = []; let enter_audiotest_page = { type: 'audio-keyboard-with-replay', prompt: \"<div id=centerbox><p>\" + \"The task you are about to do requires listening to sounds. Please adjust your sound setting.<br> \" + \"<p>We will do a simple task to make sure you can hear the sounds. </p>\" + \"<p>In the next pages, press the alphabet key associated with the played sound to proceed. </p> \" + \"<br><p>If you are ready, press the <strong>'n'</strong> key to proceed.</p>\" + \"<p>If the key doesn't work, please click the screen and press again.</p></div>\", choices: ['n'], }; block_audiotest.push(enter_audiotest_page); for (let ii = 0; ii < audio_test_order.length; ii++) { let audiotest_trial = { type: 'audio-keyboard-with-replay', stimulus: get_audio_url(audio_url, audio_test_order[ii]), prompt: \"<div id=centerbox><p>\" + \"Trial \" + (ii + 1) + \" / \" + audio_test_order.length + \" : \" + \"Please press the alphabet key you just heard.</p>\" + \"<br><p>To replay, press the <strong>'r'</strong> key. </p></div>\", choices: [audio_test_order[ii]], on_finish: function (data) { audio_test_rt.push(data.rt) } } block_audiotest.push(audiotest_trial); } return { timeline: block_audiotest }; } Change 5: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function The main experiment codes are wrapped in the initExp function to make sure it runs after all the necessary library and plugin files are loaded (as defined in the loadScript function above). /* Change 5: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function */ function initExp() { // push all the procedures, which are defined in stop-it_main.js to the overall timeline var timeline = []; // this array stores the events we want to run in the experiment // use the full screen // also playing sound only works after an interaction with user, like button press timeline.push({ type: 'fullscreen', message: '<p>Audio test will start to play when you press the button below.</p><br>', fullscreen_mode: true }); timeline.push(generate_audiotest_block(audio_url, audio_seed)); timeline.push({ type: 'fullscreen', fullscreen_mode: false }); jsPsych.init({ display_element: 'display_stage', timeline: timeline, // see the Change 6 }); } Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions When the jsPsych ends, display_stage and display_stage_background should be removed. This script also saves additional data (test order and RT) to Qualtrics Embedded Data. After saving, the script executes the clickNextButton to simulate clicking the Next button and proceed to the next question. on_finish: function () { /* Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions.*/ // save the induction-related data to Qualtrics Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"audio_test_rt\", audio_test_rt.toString().replace(/,/g, ';')); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"audio_test_order\", audio_test_order.toString().replace(/,/g, ';')); // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); }","title":"Embedding Quick Audio Test"},{"location":"audio-test/#embedding-a-quick-audio-test-into-qualtrics","text":"Before running an auditory task (like mood induction or dual n-back), you should make sure participants can listen to sound.

You can first try the task by clicking HERE . For details of demo-flanker.html , please read the separate tutorial in this GitHub repository . The start: demo-flanker-task.html The experiment code, demo-flanker.html is included in the examples folder in the jsPsych repository . Let's make the code work in a separate folder like the hello-world example . To do so, you need to change the url of jsPsych scripts, stylesheet, and stimuli of the experiment code. In this tutorial, we will change those twice to make the flanker task (1) run on a new folder and (2) use the GitHub-hosted resources. First, let's make it run locally. To do so, The jsPsych library, plugins, and stylesheet come from the local folder. As you can see, the demo-flanker.html in this repository looks at the local jspsych-6.1.0 folder for these files. <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-image-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\"></link> The experiment also needs stimuli images. So, you need to create a folder called img in the experiment folder and copy con1.png , con2.png , inc1.png , and inc2.png into the img folder. Your folder should look like this (and imagine the html file has the name demo-flanker.html ). Using files in public GitHub repositories To use jsPsych in Qualtrics, the jsPsych javascript and CSS files need to be online and loadable from Qualtrics. You can make your files online using GitHub Pages, as explained in the Hosting jsPsych or the Hosting RT Task . But you can do so WITHOUT setting up your own GitHub Pages. If you see a GitHub file that you want to embed in your experiment, like jspsych.js in jsPsych GitHub , you can use jSDelivr to fetch the file like https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<github-username>/<repository-name>/<file-name> : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jspsych/jsPsych/jspsych.js . WARNING: If you are developing your experiment and making frequent changes, jsDelivr is NOT your best option because it takes up to 24 hours to serve the modified files. Read How to use jsDelivr to learn more about jsDelivr and Content Delivery Network (CDN) in general. Using this tutorial's GitHub files for the flanker task This jsPsych-in-Qualtrics repository has the files necessary to run the flanker task. These files can be embedded via jSDelivr (github-username: kywch , repository-name: jsPsych-in-Qualtrics , experiment-folder: flanker ). You need eight files to run the flanker experiment. jspsych.css : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css jspsych.js : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js jspsych-image-keyboard-response.js : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-image-keyboard-response.js con1.png : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/img/con1.png con2.png : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/img/con2.png inc1.png : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/img/inc1.png inc2.png : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/img/inc2.png First transformation: demo-flanker-transformed.html and flanker_main.js I prefer to separate out the experiment-related code from the operation-related code, following the Experiment Factory style. If you haven't, please visit the Experiment Factory library , which contain a ton of experiments with running demos and their code. In the demo-flanker.html , constructing the timeline can be considered to be experiment-related, and the remaining parts that also appear in the Hello-World example , such as loading jspsych.js and jsPsych.init() , can be considered to be operation-related. Here, I am separating the experiment-related code and the operation-related code and putting the code into flanker_main.js and demo-flanker-transformed.html , respectively, by following steps: Step 1. Copy demo-flanker.html to demo-flanker-transformed.html Step 2. Create a new file flanker_main.js And open flanker_main.js in a new editor window. Step 3. Cut and paste the experiment-related code Open demo-flanker-transformed.html . You should have both flanker_main.js and demo-flanker-transformed.html opened. Select the code from the /* experiment parameters */ line to the timeline.push(debrief_block); line, cut the selection , and paste it to flanker_main.js . REPEAT . The code is being cut-and-pasted (NOT copy-pasted). /* experiment parameters */ var reps_per_trial_type = 4; /*set up welcome block*/ var welcome = { type: \"html-keyboard-response\", stimulus: \"Welcome to the experiment. Press any key to begin.\" }; /*set up instructions block*/ var instructions = { type: \"html-keyboard-response\", stimulus: \"<p>In this task, you will see five arrows on the screen, like the example below.</p>\" + \"<img src='img/inc1.png'></img>\" + \"<p>Press the left arrow key if the middle arrow is pointing left. (<)</p>\" + \"<p>Press the right arrow key if the middle arrow is pointing right. (>)</p>\" + \"<p>Press any key to begin.</p>\", post_trial_gap: 1000 }; /*defining stimuli*/ var test_stimuli = [ { stimulus: \"img/con1.png\", data: { stim_type: 'congruent', direction: 'left'} }, { stimulus: \"img/con2.png\", data: { stim_type: 'congruent', direction: 'right'} }, { stimulus: \"img/inc1.png\", data: { stim_type: 'incongruent', direction: 'right'} }, { stimulus: \"img/inc2.png\", data: { stim_type: 'incongruent', direction: 'left'} } ]; /* defining test timeline */ var test = { timeline: [{ type: 'image-keyboard-response', choices: [37, 39], trial_duration: 1500, stimulus: jsPsych.timelineVariable('stimulus'), data: jsPsych.timelineVariable('data'), on_finish: function (data) { var correct = false; if (data.direction == 'left' && data.key_press == 37 && data.rt > -1) { correct = true; } else if (data.direction == 'right' && data.key_press == 39 && data.rt > -1) { correct = true; } data.correct = correct; }, post_trial_gap: function () { return Math.floor(Math.random() * 1500) + 500; } }], timeline_variables: test_stimuli, sample: { type: 'fixed-repetitions', size: reps_per_trial_type } }; /*defining debriefing block*/ var debrief = { type: \"html-keyboard-response\", stimulus: function () { var total_trials = jsPsych.data.get().filter({ trial_type: 'image-keyboard-response' }).count(); var accuracy = Math.round(jsPsych.data.get().filter({ correct: true }).count() / total_trials * 100); var congruent_rt = Math.round(jsPsych.data.get().filter({ correct: true, stim_type: 'congruent' }).select('rt').mean()); var incongruent_rt = Math.round(jsPsych.data.get().filter({ correct: true, stim_type: 'incongruent' }).select('rt').mean()); return \"<p>You responded correctly on <strong>\" + accuracy + \"%</strong> of the trials.</p> \" + \"<p>Your average response time for congruent trials was <strong>\" + congruent_rt + \"ms</strong>.</p>\" + \"<p>Your average response time for incongruent trials was <strong>\" + incongruent_rt + \"ms</strong>.</p>\" + \"<p>Press any key to complete the experiment. Thank you!</p>\"; } }; /*set up experiment structure*/ var timeline = []; timeline.push(welcome); timeline.push(instructions); timeline.push(test); timeline.push(debrief); Step 4. flanker_main.js : Use the GitHub-hosted stimuli images Let's use the above GitHub-hosted images . The flanker_main.js in this tutorial has a few changes to do so. Let's see these changes. Change 1: Adding the image hosting site The repo_site variable was added to locate the JSDELIVR site that hosts stimuli images. You can easily use your repository by changing this line. // Use JSDELIVR to get the files from a GitHub repository // https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<github-username>/<repository-name>/<specific folder or file> var repo_site = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/\"; Change 2: Adding repo_site in instructions The repo_site variable should be added to wherever img/con1.png , img/con2.png , img/inc1.png , and img/inc2.png are used like the below. The find function really helps in doing so. var instructions = { type: \"html-keyboard-response\", stimulus: \"<p>In this task, you will see five arrows on the screen, like the example below.</p>\" + \"<img src='\" + repo_site + \"img/inc1.png'></img>\" + \"<p>Press the left arrow key if the middle arrow is pointing left. (<)</p>\" + \"<p>Press the right arrow key if the middle arrow is pointing right. (>)</p>\" + \"<p>Press any key to begin.</p>\", post_trial_gap: 1000 }; Change 3: Adding repo_site in test_stimuli var test_stimuli = [ { stimulus: repo_site + \"img/con1.png\", data: { stim_type: 'congruent', direction: 'left'} }, { stimulus: repo_site + \"img/con2.png\", data: { stim_type: 'congruent', direction: 'right'} }, { stimulus: repo_site + \"img/inc1.png\", data: { stim_type: 'incongruent', direction: 'right'} }, { stimulus: repo_site + \"img/inc2.png\", data: { stim_type: 'incongruent', direction: 'left'} } ]; Step 5. demo-flanker-transformed.html : Import flanker_main.js Cutting the experiment-related code makes the demo-flanker-transformed.html file much shorter. Let's also use the GitHub-hosted JS and CSS files (above) . In addition, you also need to load flanker_main.js by using a <script> tag like the other jspsych plugin files (see the original jsPsych tutorial ). You can use your own repository by creating the jsDelivr link by following this guide . CHANGE 1: Using the GitHub-hosted JS and CSS files <!-- CHANGE 1: Using the GitHub-hosted files --> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-image-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\"> CHANGE 2: Loading the main experiment script in the same local folder <!-- CHANGE 2: Loading the main experiment script in the same folder--> <script src=\"flanker_main.js\"></script> Does this work? Let's find out by opening demo-flanker-transformed.html in a browser. Step 6: Upload demo-flanker-transformed.html and flanker_main.js to GitHub If this works, you may want to start a new GitHub repository for this task, as I did with my simple Reaction Time Task . Or, you may just want to try this flanker task in the Qualtrics. In that case, you can use the flanker_main.js in this tutorial GitHub repository, which is at https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/flanker_main.js and available for Qualtrics to load. Second transformation: demo-flanker-transformed-with-display-element.html Adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() and having additional control over the display element is important for embedding jsPsych into Qualtrics. The demo-flanker-transformed-with-display-element.html file in this GitHub repository contains three changes from the demo-flanker-transformed.html . When you open demo-flanker-transformed-with-display-element.html in a browser, you should see the same flanker task. Let's look at each change. Change 1: Using display_element By adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() like below, jsPsych will render the experiment in the <div> called display_stage , which the current script does not have yet. So, let's add the display_stage . /* start the experiment */ jsPsych.init({ timeline: timeline, /* Change 1: Using `display_element` */ display_element: 'display_stage', on_finish: function () { jsPsych.data.displayData(); } }); Change 2: Adding display_stage CSS and Div The display_stage needs below CSS and HTML code after the <body> tag, which also include the display_stage_background . Both are necessary to function well. <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <div id='display_stage_background'></div> <div id='display_stage'></div> Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics The below scripts are not necessary to run this reaction time experiment, but you need to copy-paste these in Qualtrics later. One critical point is that now we use the jsPsych stylesheet hosted in the GitHub Pages (explained above in the Using the jsPsych files section) instead of the CSS file in your computer. This is important because Qualtrics can also access the GitHub-hosted files. <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- Use JSDELIVR to get the files from a GitHub repository https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<github-username>/<repository-name>/<specific folder or file> --> <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> Third transformation: demo-flanker-qualtrics.js To make your jsPsych experiment work in Qualtrics, you need to add your code to the below skeleton provided by Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. For details, see the Add JavaScript help page . Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page loads*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is fully displayed*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is unloaded*/ }); The demo-flanker-qualtrics.js file in this GitHub repository contains several changes from demo-flanker-transformed-with-display-element.html and can be direclty copy-pasted into the Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. By separating the experiment-related code from the operation-related code, converting the html file to Qualtrics JavaScript function is pretty much similar to the Hello-World example . Let's look at each change. Change 1: Hiding the Next button The below javascript code hides the Next button and puts the javascript code in the driving seat. // Retrieve Qualtrics object and save in qthis var qthis = this; // Hide buttons qthis.hideNextButton(); Change 2: Defining and load required resources The below javascript defines where the necessary files are so that Qualtrics can load these. If you enabled GitHub Pages of your repository, Qualtrics can load the necessary JS, CSS, and image files right away. Or, you can provide the embeddable links via jsDelivr. Here, let's continue to use jsDelivr. One way to check whether these files are accessilbe is to view the source of demo-flanker-transformed.html and click the imported scripts. For example of jspsych.js , https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js . // https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<github-username>/<repository-name>/<experiment-folder> var task_github = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kywch/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/flanker/\"; // requiredResources must include all the JS files that demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html uses. var requiredResources = [ task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\", task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\", task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-image-keyboard-response.js\", task_github + \"flanker_main.js\" ]; function loadScript(idx) { console.log(\"Loading \", requiredResources[idx]); jQuery.getScript(requiredResources[idx], function () { if ((idx + 1) < requiredResources.length) { loadScript(idx + 1); } else { initExp(); } }); } if (window.Qualtrics && (!window.frameElement || window.frameElement.id !== \"mobile-preview-view\")) { loadScript(0); } Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery In Qualtrics, jQuery (loaded by default) is used to append the display_stage_background and display_stage Divs. The CSS for these elements will be added directly to Question HTML later in this tutorial. // jQuery is loaded in Qualtrics by default jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage_background'></div>\").appendTo('body'); jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage'></div>\").appendTo('body'); Change 4: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function The main experiment codes are wrapped in the initExp function to make sure it runs after all the necessary library and plugin files are loaded (as defined in the loadScript function above). Change 5: Summarizing and save the results to Qualtrics The jsPsych tutorial shows you how you can process and summarize the experiment results online. Wouldn't it be great if your experiment results are directly included in your Qualtrics data? Well, you can actually summarize the results online and save those results in Qualtrics' Embedded Data using the setEmbeddedData function. demo-flanker-qualtrics.js does so when the jsPsych experiment finishes by running the below code from debrief_block . jsPsych.init({ timeline: timeline, display_element: 'display_stage', on_finish: function (data) { /* Change 5: Summarizing and save the results to Qualtrics */ // summarize the results var total_trials = jsPsych.data.get().filter({ trial_type: 'image-keyboard-response' }).count(); var accuracy = Math.round(jsPsych.data.get().filter({ correct: true }).count() / total_trials * 100); var congruent_rt = Math.round(jsPsych.data.get().filter({ correct: true, stim_type: 'congruent' }).select('rt').mean()); var incongruent_rt = Math.round(jsPsych.data.get().filter({ correct: true, stim_type: 'incongruent' }).select('rt').mean()); // save to qualtrics embedded data Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"accuracy\", accuracy); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"congruent_rt\", congruent_rt); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"incongruent_rt\", incongruent_rt); /* Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions.*/ // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); } }); Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions When the jsPsych ends, display_stage and display_stage_background should be removed. Then, execulte the clickNextButton to simulate clicking the Next button and proceed to the next question. Finally, embedding jsPsych in Qualtrics Let's log in to Qualtrics and take a look at each step. Step 1. Create a new Qualtrics project and then a new question This tutorial assumes that readers are much more familiar with Qualtrics. For Qualtrics tutorial, there are other excellent tutorials available like this Qualtrics User Guide . To continue, please create a new Qualtrics project. Then, create a new question and (1) change its format to Text/Graphic . Step 2. Open the Question JavaScript editor and copy paste the whole demo-simple-rt-task-qualtrics.js Keep going in the above picture. (2) Click the gear to open the dropdown menu, and then (3) find and click Add JavaScript . Step 3.

Step 4. Creating Embedded Data elements To store the experiment results -- accuracy , congruent_rt , and incongruent_rt -- in Qualtrics, you need to create the Embedded Data elements named accuracy , congruent_rt , and incongruent_rt in your survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Click Survey Flow from the Survey tab Click Add a New Element Here Choose Embedded Data Click Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown and type accuracy Click Set a Value Now and type -1 Click Add a New Field and type congruent_rt Click Set a Value Now and type -1 Click Add a New Field and type incogruent_rt Click Set a Value Now and type -1 Step 5. Move Set Embedded Data block to the top of Survey Flow The accuracy , congruent_rt , and incongruent_rt fields should be defined before the jsPsych reaction time task, so you need to move the Embedded Data block to the top of the Survey Flow. Click and hold down Move to drag the Embedded Data to the top of the Survey Flow. After this, you should see the Survey Flow like below. Step 6. Add a check for the Embedded Data You should make sure that the experiment results are saved correctly. You can do so by showing the accuracy , congruent_rt , and incongruent_rt Embedded Data after the reaction task. Click Add Page Break Click Create a New Question Change Question Type to Text/Graphic Type ${e://Field/accuracy} , ${e://Field/congruent_rt} , and ${e://Field/incongruent_rt} to access these Embedded Data Step 7. Publish and test! Publish the survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Then, an anonymous Qualtrics link is generated. If you click this link, you should be able to see the same reaction time task running in Qualtrics. For example, try this Qualtrics link . Do you also want to save the trial-by-trial data?

In this tutorial, we will change those twice to make the flanker task (1) run on a new folder and (2) use the GitHub-hosted resources. First, let's make it run locally. To do so, The jsPsych library, plugins, and stylesheet come from the local folder.

To do so, you need to use the display_element option, which was briefly mentioned in the jsPsych tutorial . The start: experiment.html After completing the original jsPsych \"Hello world!\" example , your folder should look like this. When you open experiment.html using your programming-friendly text editor, such as Atom or VSCode , you should see the html code like below. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My experiment</title> <script src=\"jspsych-6.0.5/jspsych.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.0.5/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <link href=\"jspsych-6.0.5/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link> </head> <body></body> <script> var hello_trial = { type: 'html-keyboard-response', stimulus: 'Hello world!' } jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial] }) </script> </html> When you open experiment.html in a browser, you should see \"Hello world!\" printed on the screen, and if you press a key on the keyboard, the text should disappear (ending the trial). First transformation: experiment-with-display-element.html Adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() and having additional control over the display element is important for embedding jsPsych into Qualtrics. The experiment-with-display-element.html file in this GitHub repository contains three changes from the experiment.html . When you open experiment-with-display-element.html in a browser, you should see the same \"Hello world!\". Let's look at each change. Change 1: Using display_element By adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() like below, jsPsych will render the experiment in the ' ' called display_stage , which the current script does not have yet. So, let's add the display_stage . jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage' }) Change 2: Adding display_stage CSS and Div The display_stage needs below CSS and HTML code after the <body> tag, which also include the display_stage_background . Both are necessary to function well. <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <div id='display_stage_background'></div> <div id='display_stage'></div> Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics The below scripts are not necessary to run this hello-world experiment, but you need to copy-paste these in Qualtrics later. One critical point is that now we use the jsPsych stylesheet hosted in the GitHub Pages (explained in the Hosting jsPsych section) instead of the CSS file in your computer. This is important because Qualtrics can also access the GitHub-hosted files. <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> Putting it all together So the experiment-with-display-element.html code looks like this. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My experiment</title> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <link href=\"jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link> </head> <body> <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE UP TO QUALTRICS TO HERE --> <div id='display_stage_background'></div> <div id='display_stage'></div> </body> <script> var hello_trial = { type: 'html-keyboard-response', stimulus: 'Hello world!' } /* Change 1: Using `display_element` */ jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage' }) </script> </html> Second transformation: qualtrics.js To make your jsPsych experiment work in Qualtrics, you need to add your code to the below skeleton provided by Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. For details, see the Add JavaScript help page . Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page loads*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is fully displayed*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is unloaded*/ }); The qualtrics.js file in this GitHub repository contains several changes from experiment-with-display-element.html and can be direclty copy-pasted into the Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. Let's look at each change. Change 1: Hiding the Next button The below javascript code hides the Next button and puts the javascript code in the driving seat. // Retrieve Qualtrics object and save in qthis var qthis = this; // Hide buttons qthis.hideNextButton(); Change 2: Defining and load required resources The below javascript defines where the necessary files are so that Qualtrics can load these. After Making jsPsych files loadable in Qualtrics , you should be able to put your github page url at jslib_url . var jslib_url = \"https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/\"; // \"https://<your-github-username>.github.io/jsPsych/\" // the below urls must be accessible with your browser // for example, https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/jspsych.js var requiredResources = [ jslib_url + \"jspsych.js\", jslib_url + \"plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\" ]; function loadScript(idx) { console.log(\"Loading \", requiredResources[idx]); jQuery.getScript(requiredResources[idx], function () { if ((idx + 1) < requiredResources.length) { loadScript(idx + 1); } else { initExp(); } }); } if (window.Qualtrics && (!window.frameElement || window.frameElement.id !== \"mobile-preview-view\")) { loadScript(0); } Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery In Qualtrics, jQuery (loaded by default) is used to append the display_stage_background and display_stage Divs. The CSS for these elements will be added directly to Question HTML later in this tutorial. // jQuery is loaded in Qualtrics by default jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage_background'></div>\").appendTo('body'); jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage'></div>\").appendTo('body'); Change 4: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function The main experiment codes are wrapped in the initExp function to make sure it runs after all the necessary library and plugin files are loaded (as defined in the loadScript function above). function initExp() { var hello_trial = { type: 'html-keyboard-response', stimulus: 'Hello world!' } jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage', }); } Change 5: Adding the clean up and continue functions When the jsPsych ends, display_stage and display_stage_background should be removed. Then, execulte the clickNextButton to simulate clicking the Next button and proceed to the next question. on_finish: function (data) { // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); } Putting it all together So the qualtrics.js code looks like this. Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function () { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page loads*/ /* Change 2: Hiding the Next button */ // Retrieve Qualtrics object and save in qthis var qthis = this; // Hide buttons qthis.hideNextButton(); /* Change 3: Defining and load required resources */ var jslib_url = \"https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/\"; // the below urls must be accessible with your browser // for example, https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/jspsych.js var requiredResources = [ jslib_url + \"jspsych.js\", jslib_url + \"plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\" ]; function loadScript(idx) { console.log(\"Loading \", requiredResources[idx]); jQuery.getScript(requiredResources[idx], function () { if ((idx + 1) < requiredResources.length) { loadScript(idx + 1); } else { initExp(); } }); } if (window.Qualtrics && (!window.frameElement || window.frameElement.id !== \"mobile-preview-view\")) { loadScript(0); } /* Change 4: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery */ // jQuery is loaded in Qualtrics by default jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage_background'></div>\").appendTo('body'); jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage'></div>\").appendTo('body'); /* Change 5: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function */ function initExp() { var hello_trial = { type: 'html-keyboard-response', stimulus: 'Hello world!' } jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage', /* Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions.*/ on_finish: function (data) { // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); } }); } }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function () { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is fully displayed*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function () { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is unloaded*/ }); Finally, embedding jsPsych in Qualtrics Let's log in to Qualtrics and take a look at each step. Step 1. Create a new Qualtrics project and then a new question This tutorial assumes that readers are much more familiar with Qualtrics. For Qualtrics tutorial, there are other excellent tutorials available like this Qualtrics User Guide . To continue, please create a new Qualtrics project. Then, create a new question and (1) change its format to Text/Graphic . Step 2. Open the Question JavaScript editor and copy paste the whole qualtrics.js Keep going in the above picture. (2) Click the gear to open the dropdown menu, and then (3) find and click Add JavaScript . Step 3. Open the Question HTML editor and copy paste the portion of experiment-with-display-element.html The Change 3 section of the experiment-with-display-element.html file contains the link to jsPsych CSS file, the inline styles for display_stage Div, and the error message to be displayed when things go wrong. To open the HTML editor, click the HTML View button. Then, copy paste the portion of experiment-with-display-element.html to the HTML editor, starting from <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> to <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> . <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> After copy pasting, you should see something like below. Step 4. Publish and test! Publish the survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Then, an anonymous Qualtrics link is generated. If you click this link, you should be able to see \"Hello World!\" in Qualtrics. For example, here is a just another Hello-World Qualtrics survey . Do you want to save the trial-by-trial results?

Before running an auditory task (like mood induction or dual n-back), you should make sure participants can listen to sound. To do so, I also made a quick audio test using jsPsych. You can first try the test by clicking HERE . See the Embedding Quick Audio Test tutorial to use this in Qualtrics. I put these codes into the Mood Induction repository . You can either directly use these files or fork this repository to customize. This tutorial consists of two parts. (1) I will first explain how you can embed the mood induction in Qualtrics . (2) I will then explain the experiment code . Embedding the Mood Induction into Qualtrics Hosting the Mood Induction scripts in GitHub To use jsPsych in Qualtrics, the jsPsych javascript and CSS files need to be online and loadable from Qualtrics. Creating a GitHub repository for your experiment helps you do so in simple steps. Go to the Mood Induction repository . Follow the Hosting jsPsych tutorial to fork it to your GitHub repository and make the scripts available online. Also make sure that sound files play on your browser. When you are done, you can check the online files with your browser by directly going to the jspsych.js , jspsych.css , jspsych-fullscreen.js , and jspsych-mood-induction.js . jspsych.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js . jspsych.css should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css . jspsych-fullscreen.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-fullscreen.js , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-fullscreen.js . jspsych-mood-induction.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-mood-induction.js , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-mood-induction.js . Sound files are stored in the music folder and should be available online. Embedding the task to Qualtrics Let's log in to Qualtrics and take a look at each step. Step 1. Create a new Qualtrics project and then a new question This tutorial assumes that readers are much more familiar with Qualtrics. For Qualtrics tutorial, there are other excellent tutorials available like this Qualtrics User Guide . To continue, please create a new Qualtrics project. Then, create a new question and (1) change its format to Text/Graphic . Step 2. Open the Question JavaScript editor and copy paste the whole mood-induction-qualtrics.js Keep going in the above picture. (2) Click the gear to open the dropdown menu, and then (3) find and click Add JavaScript . Then copy-paste the whole mood-induction-qualtrics.js (click to see the code) into the editor. ALSO CHECK WHETHER THE URL, task_github , IS VALID. Step 3. Open the Question HTML editor and copy paste the below html code The Change 3 section of the mood-induction-demo.html file contains the link to jsPsych CSS file, the inline styles for display_stage Div, and the error message to be displayed when things go wrong. To open the HTML editor, click the HTML View button. Then, copy paste the portion of mood-induction-demo.html to the HTML editor, starting from <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> to <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> . <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"> <b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } #centerbox { width: 80vh; height: 20vh; position: relative; top: 40%; font-size: 22pt; line-height: normal; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> After copy pasting, you should see something like below. Step 4. Create Embedded Data elements To store the addition details about this audio test, you need to create the Embedded Data elements named mood , mood_script_order and mood_spent_time in your survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Click Survey Flow from the Survey tab Click Add a New Element Here Choose Embedded Data Click Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown and type mood Click Add a New Field and type mood_script_order Click Add a New Field and type mood_spent_time Click Move of the new blocks you created ( Set Embedded Data and Then Branch If ) and move these blocks the top of Survey Flow Step 5. Publish and test! Publish the survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Then, an anonymous Qualtrics link is generated. If you click this link, you should be able to see the same Audio Test running in Qualtrics. For example, try this Qualtrics link . Explaining the code For the basics, please read the Hello world tutorial . A working demo in a local browser: mood-induction-demo.html Adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() and having additional control over the display element is important for embedding jsPsych into Qualtrics. The changes in mood-induction-demo.html (click to see the code) are in the same order as in the Hello world tutorial . You should be able to run the audio test simply by opening mood-induction-demo.html in a browser. Let's look at each change. Change 1: Using display_element By adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() like below, jsPsych will render the experiment in the <div> called display_stage , which the current script does not have yet. So, let's add the display_stage . /* Change 1: Using `display_element` */ jsPsych.init({ timeline: timeline, display_element: 'display_stage' }) Change 2: Adding display_stage CSS and Div The display_stage needs below CSS and HTML code after the <body> tag, which also include the display_stage_background . Both are necessary to function well. The centerbox is where we put the text prompts. <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } #centerbox { width: 80vh; height: 20vh; position: relative; top: 40%; font-size: 22pt; line-height: normal; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> <div id='display_stage_background'></div> <div id='display_stage'></div> Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics The below scripts are not necessary to run this task, but you need to copy-paste these in Qualtrics later. One critical point is that now we use the jsPsych stylesheet hosted in the GitHub Pages (explained above in the Hosting jsPsych section) instead of the CSS file in your computer. This is important because Qualtrics can also access the GitHub-hosted files. <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"> <b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> Qualtrics transformation: mood-induction-qualtrics.js To make your jsPsych experiment work in Qualtrics, you need to add your code to the below skeleton provided by Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. For details, see the Add JavaScript help page . Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page loads*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is fully displayed*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is unloaded*/ }); Let's look at each change. Change 1: Hiding the Next button The below javascript code hides the Next button and puts the javascript code in the driving seat. /* Change 1: Hiding the Next button */ // Retrieve Qualtrics object and save in qthis var qthis = this; // Hide buttons qthis.hideNextButton(); Change 2: Defining and load required resources The below javascript defines where the necessary files are so that Qualtrics can load these. If you enabled GitHub Pages of your repository, Qualtrics can load the necessary JS, CSS, and image files right away. AFTER TESTING, CHANGE the flag_debug variable to false . /* Change 2: Defining and load required resources */ // task-related variables var flag_debug = true; var time_unit = 1000; // ms var mood_spent_time = ''; var script_order = ''; // requiredResources must include all the required JS files var task_github = \"https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/\"; // https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name> var requiredResources = [ task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\", task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-fullscreen.js\", task_github + \"jspsych-mood-induction.js\" ]; function loadScript(idx) { console.log(\"Loading \", requiredResources[idx]); jQuery.getScript(requiredResources[idx], function () { if ((idx + 1) < requiredResources.length) { loadScript(idx + 1); } else { initExp(); } }); } if (window.Qualtrics && (!window.frameElement || window.frameElement.id !== \"mobile-preview-view\")) { loadScript(0); } Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery In Qualtrics, jQuery (loaded by default) is used to append the display_stage_background and display_stage Divs. The CSS for these elements will be added directly to Question HTML later in this tutorial. /* Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery */ // jQuery is loaded in Qualtrics by default jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage_background'></div>\").appendTo('body'); jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage'></div>\").appendTo('body'); Change 4: Adding resources, scripts, and helper functions Note that the music-only duration is set to 60 s (or 6 s when flag_debug is true ) and the prompt duration is set to 30 s (or 3 s when flag_debug is true ). See inside the function generate_mood_induction to modify these. /* Change 4: Adding resouces, scripts, and helper functions */ var mood_music = { happy: task_github + 'music/Mazurka_HappyMIP.mp3', // happy angry: task_github + 'music/NightOnBaldMountain_AngerMIP.mp3', // angry fear: task_github + 'music/PsychoTheme_FearMIP.mp3', // fear sad: task_github + 'music/ChopinOpus28no6_SadMIP.mp3', // sad neutral: task_github + 'music/ChopinWaltz11_NeutralMIP.mp3' // neutral }; var mood_scripts = {}; mood_scripts['happy'] = [ // happy \"You just got a new job, and it's even better than you expected.\", \"You wake up on a Saturday after a number of wintry-cold rainy days, and the temperature is in the high sixties.\", \"You buy a lottery ticket and you win $100.00 instantly.\", \"You and a friend go to a nice restaurant.

You can pass mood via URL parameter, like ?mood=happy , and this script can read it by piping from an Embedded Data mood . /* Change 5: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function */ function initExp() { var mood = \"${e://Field/mood}\"; // experimental session-defining variables if (flag_debug) { // WARNING: WHEN DEPLOYING THIS, BE SURE TO CHANGE flag_debug to false // if true: make the button appear faster time_unit = 100; // ms instead of 1000 ms console.log('Entered mood: ', mood); } // push all the procedures, which are defined in stop-it_main.js to the overall timeline var timeline = []; // this array stores the events we want to run in the experiment // use the full screen // also playing sound only works after an interaction with user, like button press timeline.push({ type: 'fullscreen', message: '<p>Music will start to play when you press the button below.</p><br>', fullscreen_mode: true }); timeline.push(generate_mood_induction(mood)); timeline.push({ type: 'fullscreen', fullscreen_mode: false }); jsPsych.init({ display_element: 'display_stage', timeline: timeline, // see the Change 6 }); } Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions When the jsPsych ends, display_stage and display_stage_background should be removed. This script also saves additional data (script order and spent time)) to Qualtrics Embedded Data. After saving, the script executes the clickNextButton to simulate clicking the Next button and proceed to the next question. on_finish: function () { /* Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions.*/ // save the induction-related data to Qualtrics Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"mood_script_order\", script_order); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"mood_spent_time\", mood_spent_time); if (flag_debug) { console.log('Mood script order: ', script_order); console.log('Mood spent time: ', mood_spent_time); } // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); }","title":"Embedding Mood Induction"},{"location":"mood-induction/#embedding-mood-induction-into-qualtrics","text":"The mood induction procedures by Mayer et al.

When you are done, you can check the online files with your browser by directly going to the jspsych.js , jspsych.css , jspsych-fullscreen.js , and jspsych-mood-induction.js . jspsych.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js . jspsych.css should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css . jspsych-fullscreen.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-fullscreen.js , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-fullscreen.js . jspsych-mood-induction.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-mood-induction.js , like https://kywch.github.io/Mood-Induction_jsPsych/jspsych-mood-induction.js . Sound files are stored in the music folder and should be available online.","title":"Hosting the Mood Induction scripts in GitHub"},{"location":"mood-induction/#embedding-the-task-to-qualtrics","text":"Let's log in to Qualtrics and take a look at each step.","title":"Embedding the task to Qualtrics"},{"location":"mood-induction/#step-1-create-a-new-qualtrics-project-and-then-a-new-question","text":"This tutorial assumes that readers are much more familiar with Qualtrics.

You can first try the task by clicking HERE . The start: demo-simple-rt-task.html The experiment code, demo-simple-rt-task.html is included in the examples folder in the jsPsych repository . Let's make the code work in a separate folder like the hello-world example . To do so, you need to change the url of jsPsych scripts, stylesheet, and stimuli of the experiment code. In this tutorial, we will change those twice to make the rt-task (1) run on a new folder and (2) use the GitHub-hosted resources. First, let's make it run locally. To do so, The jsPsych library, plugins, and stylesheet come from the local folder. As you can see, the demo-simple-rt-task.html in this repository looks at the local jspsych-6.1.0 folder for these files. <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-image-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\"></link> The experiment also needs stimuli images (see the original jsPsych tutorial ). So, you need to create a folder called img in the experiment folder and copy blue.png and orange.png into the img folder. Your folder should look like this. Hosting this task in GitHub To use jsPsych in Qualtrics, the jsPsych javascript and CSS files need to be online and loadable from Qualtrics. Creating a GitHub repository for your experiment helps you do so in simple steps. Step 0. Create a GitHub account Go to the GitHub site and create your account. Step 1. Create a new GitHub repository Create a repository for your experiment by following this Create a repo guide . Step 2. Add experiment files to the repository Upload your experiment files to the repository. The easy way is to drag and drop your files like this Adding a file to a repository guide . Do NOT forget to click the Commit changes button. My Simple-RT-Task repository looks like this: https://github.com/kywch/Simple-RT-Task/ . Step 3. Click the Settings button Click the Settings button on the repository home page. Step 4. Enable GitHub Pages for your experiment Scroll down and find the GitHub Pages section. Select the Source to be the master branch . Within a few minutes, a website will be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/ . How do you know the page is up and running? Well, let's try to access the jspsych.css file by going into https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css . For example, https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css . WAIT, did you know? Did you know that you also accidentally made your task online that anyone with the Internet can try your task? Open your browser and go to https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/demo-simple-rt-task.html , or try mine: https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/demo-simple-rt-task.html . If your expeirment doesnt' work, (this may sound silly but worked for me) try to turn off and on the GitHub Pages multiple times (i.e., switching the Source to be None and master branch ). First transformation: demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html and rt-task_main.js I prefer to separate out the experiment-related code from the operation-related code, following the Experiment Factory style. If you haven't, please visit the Experiment Factory library , which contain a ton of experiments with running demos and their code. In the demo-simple-rt-task.html , constructing the timeline can be considered to be experiment-related, and the remaining parts that also appear in the Hello-World example , such as loading jspsych.js and jsPsych.init() can be considered to be operation-related. Here, I am separating the experiment-related code and the operation-related code and putting the code into rt-task_main.js and demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html , respectively, by following steps: Step 1. Copy demo-simple-rt-task.html to demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html Step 2. Create a new file rt-task_main.js And open rt-task_main.js in a new editor window. Step 3. Cut and paste the experiment-related code Open demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html . You should have both rt-task_main.js and demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html opened. Select the code from the /* create timeline */ line to the timeline.push(debrief_block); line, cut the selection , and paste it to rt-task_main.js . REPEAT . The code is being cut-and-pasted (NOT copy-pasted). /* create timeline */ var timeline = []; /* define welcome message trial */ var welcome_block = { type: \"html-keyboard-response\", stimulus: \"Welcome to the experiment. Press any key to begin.\" }; timeline.push(welcome_block); /* define instructions trial */ var instructions = { type: \"html-keyboard-response\", stimulus: \"<p>In this experiment, a circle will appear in the center \" + \"of the screen.</p><p>If the circle is <strong>blue</strong>, \" + \"press the letter F on the keyboard as fast as you can.</p>\" + \"<p>If the circle is <strong>orange</strong>, press the letter J \" + \"as fast as you can.</p>\" + \"<div style='width: 700px;'>\"+ \"<div style='float: left;'><img src='img/blue.png'></img>\" + \"<p class='small'><strong>Press the F key</strong></p></div>\" + \"<div class='float: right;'><img src='img/orange.png'></img>\" + \"<p class='small'><strong>Press the J key</strong></p></div>\" + \"</div>\"+ \"<p>Press any key to begin.</p>\", post_trial_gap: 2000 }; timeline.push(instructions); /* test trials */ var test_stimuli = [ { stimulus: \"img/blue.png\", data: { test_part: 'test', correct_response: 'f' } }, { stimulus: \"img/orange.png\", data: { test_part: 'test', correct_response: 'j' } } ]; var fixation = { type: 'html-keyboard-response', stimulus: '<div style=\"font-size:60px;\">+</div>', choices: jsPsych.NO_KEYS, trial_duration: function(){ return jsPsych.randomization.sampleWithoutReplacement([250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000], 1)[0]; }, data: {test_part: 'fixation'} } var test = { type: \"image-keyboard-response\", stimulus: jsPsych.timelineVariable('stimulus'), choices: ['f', 'j'], data: jsPsych.timelineVariable('data'), on_finish: function(data){ data.correct = data.key_press == jsPsych.pluginAPI.convertKeyCharacterToKeyCode(data.correct_response); }, } var test_procedure = { timeline: [fixation, test], timeline_variables: test_stimuli, repetitions: 5, randomize_order: true } timeline.push(test_procedure); /* define debrief */ var debrief_block = { type: \"html-keyboard-response\", stimulus: function() { var trials = jsPsych.data.get().filter({test_part: 'test'}); var correct_trials = trials.filter({correct: true}); var accuracy = Math.round(correct_trials.count() / trials.count() * 100); var rt = Math.round(correct_trials.select('rt').mean()); return \"<p>You responded correctly on \"+accuracy+\"% of the trials.</p>\"+ \"<p>Your average response time was \"+rt+\"ms.</p>\"+ \"<p>Press any key to complete the experiment. Thank you!</p>\"; } }; timeline.push(debrief_block); Step 4. rt-task_main.js : Use the GitHub-hosted stimuli images The above code uses the stimuli images in the img folder placed with the experiment html. But since you also put these images in your GitHub repository and made these available through the Internet, you can also use these images. The img/blue.png is available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/img/blue.png . For example, https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/img/blue.png . And, the img/orange.png is available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/img/orange.png . For example, https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/img/orange.png . The rt-task_main.js in this tutorial has a few changes to use the GitHub-hosted images. Let's see these changes. Change 1: Adding the image hosting site The repo_site variable was added to locate the site that hosts stimuli images. You can easily use your repository by changing this line. // define the site that hosts stimuli images // usually https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/ var repo_site = \"https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/\"; Change 2: Adding repo_site in instructions The repo_site variable should be added to wherever img/blue.png and img/orange.png are used like the below. The find function really helps in doing so. var instructions = { type: \"html-keyboard-response\", stimulus: \"<p>In this experiment, a circle will appear in the center \" + \"of the screen.</p><p>If the circle is <strong>blue</strong>, \" + \"press the letter F on the keyboard as fast as you can.</p>\" + \"<p>If the circle is <strong>orange</strong>, press the letter J \" + \"as fast as you can.</p>\" + \"<div style='width: 700px;'>\" + \"<div style='float: left;'><img src='\" + repo_site + \"img/blue.png'></img>\" + // Change 2: Adding `repo_site` in `instructions` \"<p class='small'><strong>Press the F key</strong></p></div>\" + \"<div class='float: right;'><img src='\" + repo_site + \"img/orange.png'></img>\" + // Change 2: Adding `repo_site` in `instructions` \"<p class='small'><strong>Press the J key</strong></p></div>\" + \"</div>\" + \"<p>Press any key to begin.</p>\", post_trial_gap: 2000 }; Change 3: Adding repo_site in test_stimuli var test_stimuli = [{ stimulus: repo_site + \"img/blue.png\", // Change 3: Adding `repo_site` in `test_stimuli` data: { test_part: 'test', correct_response: 'f' } }, { stimulus: repo_site + \"img/orange.png\", // Change 3: Adding `repo_site` in `test_stimuli` data: { test_part: 'test', correct_response: 'j' } } ]; Step 5. demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html : Import rt-task_main.js Cutting the experiment-related code makes the demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html file much shorter. To make demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html work, you need to load rt-task_main.js by using a <script> tag like the other jspsych plugin files (see the original jsPsych tutorial ). <!-- CHANGE: Loading the external main experiment script --> <script src=\"rt-task_main.js\"></script> After making these changes, don't forget to SAVE ! Does this work? Let's find out by opening demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html in a browser. Step 6: Upload demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html and rt-task_main.js to GitHub If this works, let's upload demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html and rt-task_main.js to your GitHub repository so that your task also runs over the Internet. After uploading both scripts (and waiting for a few minutes), you should be able to access https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html . For example, https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html . If the above link works, then it also means that the experiment-related code, rt-task_main.js , is also available for Qualtrics to load. You can actually access it by going to https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/rt-task_main.js . For example, https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/rt-task_main.js . Second transformation: demo-simple-rt-task-transformed-with-display-element.html Adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() and having additional control over the display element is important for embedding jsPsych into Qualtrics. The demo-simple-rt-task-transformed-with-display-element.html file in this GitHub repository contains three changes from the demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html . When you open demo-simple-rt-task-transformed-with-display-element.html in a browser, you should see the same reaction time task. Let's look at each change. Change 1: Using display_element By adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() like below, jsPsych will render the experiment in the <div> called display_stage , which the current script does not have yet. So, let's add the display_stage . /* start the experiment */ jsPsych.init({ timeline: timeline, /* Change 1: Using `display_element` */ display_element: 'display_stage', on_finish: function () { jsPsych.data.displayData(); } }); Change 2: Adding display_stage CSS and Div The display_stage needs below CSS and HTML code after the <body> tag, which also include the display_stage_background . Both are necessary to function well. <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <div id='display_stage_background'></div> <div id='display_stage'></div> Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics The below scripts are not necessary to run this reaction time experiment, but you need to copy-paste these in Qualtrics later. One critical point is that now we use the jsPsych stylesheet hosted in the GitHub Pages (explained above in the Hosting jsPsych section) instead of the CSS file in your computer. This is important because Qualtrics can also access the GitHub-hosted files. <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- jspsych.css should be availble from your GitHub at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> Third transformation: demo-simple-rt-task-qualtrics.js To make your jsPsych experiment work in Qualtrics, you need to add your code to the below skeleton provided by Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. For details, see the Add JavaScript help page . Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page loads*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is fully displayed*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is unloaded*/ }); The demo-simple-rt-task-qualtrics.js file in this GitHub repository contains several changes from demo-simple-rt-task-transformed-with-display-element.html and can be direclty copy-pasted into the Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. By separating the experiment-related code from the operation-related code, converting the html file to Qualtrics JavaScript function is pretty much similar to the Hello-World example . Let's look at each change. Change 1: Hiding the Next button The below javascript code hides the Next button and puts the javascript code in the driving seat. // Retrieve Qualtrics object and save in qthis var qthis = this; // Hide buttons qthis.hideNextButton(); Change 2: Defining and load required resources The below javascript defines where the necessary files are so that Qualtrics can load these. If you enabled GitHub Pages of your repository, Qualtrics can load the necessary JS, CSS, and image files right away. One way to check whether these files are accessilbe is to view the source of demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html and click the imported scripts. For example of jspsych.js , https://your-github-username.github.io/your-experiment-name/jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js . var task_github = \"https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/\"; // https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name> // requiredResources must include all the JS files that demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html uses. var requiredResources = [ task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\", task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\", task_github + \"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-image-keyboard-response.js\", task_github + \"rt-task_main.js\" ]; function loadScript(idx) { console.log(\"Loading \", requiredResources[idx]); jQuery.getScript(requiredResources[idx], function () { if ((idx + 1) < requiredResources.length) { loadScript(idx + 1); } else { initExp(); } }); } if (window.Qualtrics && (!window.frameElement || window.frameElement.id !== \"mobile-preview-view\")) { loadScript(0); } Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery In Qualtrics, jQuery (loaded by default) is used to append the display_stage_background and display_stage Divs. The CSS for these elements will be added directly to Question HTML later in this tutorial. // jQuery is loaded in Qualtrics by default jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage_background'></div>\").appendTo('body'); jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage'></div>\").appendTo('body'); Change 4: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function The main experiment codes are wrapped in the initExp function to make sure it runs after all the necessary library and plugin files are loaded (as defined in the loadScript function above). Change 5: Summarizing and save the results to Qualtrics The original jsPsych tutorial shows you how you can process and summarize the experiment results online. Wouldn't it be great if your experiment results are directly included in your Qualtrics data? Well, you can actually summarize the results online and save those results in Qualtrics' Embedded Data using the setEmbeddedData function. demo-simple-rt-task-qualtrics.js does so when the jsPsych experiment finishes by running the below code (from debrief_block ). jsPsych.init({ timeline: timeline, display_element: 'display_stage', on_finish: function (data) { /* Change 5: Summarizing and save the results to Qualtrics */ // summarize the results var trials = jsPsych.data.get().filter({ test_part: 'test' }); var correct_trials = trials.filter({ correct: true }); var accuracy = Math.round(correct_trials.count() / trials.count() * 100); var rt = Math.round(correct_trials.select('rt').mean()); // save to qualtrics embedded data Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"accuracy\", accuracy); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"rt\", rt); /* Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions.*/ // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); } }); Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions When the jsPsych ends, display_stage and display_stage_background should be removed. Then, execulte the clickNextButton to simulate clicking the Next button and proceed to the next question. Finally, embedding jsPsych in Qualtrics Let's log in to Qualtrics and take a look at each step. Step 1. Create a new Qualtrics project and then a new question This tutorial assumes that readers are much more familiar with Qualtrics. For Qualtrics tutorial, there are other excellent tutorials available like this Qualtrics User Guide . To continue, please create a new Qualtrics project. Then, create a new question and (1) change its format to Text/Graphic . Step 2. Open the Question JavaScript editor and copy paste the whole demo-simple-rt-task-qualtrics.js Keep going in the above picture. (2) Click the gear to open the dropdown menu, and then (3) find and click Add JavaScript . Step 3. Open the Question HTML editor and copy paste the portion of demo-simple-rt-task-transformed-with-display-element.html The Change 3 section of the demo-simple-rt-task-transformed-with-display-element.html file contains the link to jsPsych CSS file, the inline styles for display_stage Div, and the error message to be displayed when things go wrong. To open the HTML editor, click the HTML View button. Then, copy paste the portion of demo-simple-rt-task-transformed-with-display-element.html to the HTML editor, starting from <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> to <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> . <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/Simple-RT-Task/jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> After copy pasting, you should see something like below. Step 4. Create Embedded Data elements To store the experiment results -- accuracy and rt -- in Qualtrics, you need to create the Embedded Data elements named accuracy and rt in your survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Click Survey Flow from the Survey tab Click Add a New Element Here Choose Embedded Data Click Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown and type accuracy Click Set a Value Now and type -1 Click Add a New Field and type rt Click Set a Value Now and type -1 Step 5. Move Set Embedded Data block to the top of Survey Flow The accuracy and rt fields should be defined before the jsPsych reaction time task, so you need to move the Embedded Data block to the top of the Survey Flow. Click and hold down Move to drag the Embedded Data to the top of the Survey Flow. After this, you should see the Survey Flow like below. Step 6. Add a check for the Embedded Data You should make sure that the experiment results are saved correctly. You can do so by showing the accuracy and rt Embedded Data after the reaction task. Click Add Page Break Click Create a New Question Change Question Type to Text/Graphic Type ${e://Field/accuracy} and ${e://Field/rt} to access these Embedded Data Step 7. Publish and test! Publish the survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Then, an anonymous Qualtrics link is generated. If you click this link, you should be able to see the same reaction time task running in Qualtrics. For example, try this Qualtrics link . Do you also want to save the trial-by-trial data? I describe two ways for saving the experiment files in these tutorials.

In this tutorial, we will change those twice to make the rt-task (1) run on a new folder and (2) use the GitHub-hosted resources. First, let's make it run locally. To do so, The jsPsych library, plugins, and stylesheet come from the local folder. As you can see, the demo-simple-rt-task.html in this repository looks at the local jspsych-6.1.0 folder for these files. <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-image-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\"></link> The experiment also needs stimuli images (see the original jsPsych tutorial ).

You can save each participant's data file without access to a web server! Step 0. Get a Dropbox account Go to the Dropbox site and create a free account. Step 1. Create a Dropbox app for saving files Go to the Dropbox App console and sign in, if necessary. Once you see a screen like below, (1) select Dropbox API , (2) select App folder , and (3) name your app. I named my app SaveMyExperimentData . When you are done, click Create app . Step 2. Get the Dropbox access token If your app is created successfully, you will see a screen like below. Scroll down to find Generate access token and click the button to get the token. WARNING: Do NOT share this access token with anyone, including sharing your code, etc. With this code, anyone can access or delete your Dropbox files and abuse your Dropbox account. . So I suggest you two things when you finish your data collection. Invalidate the access code by deleting the app (see the Step 6 below). When you delete your app, saved files in your folder remains intact. Replace the access code with blank in your source code, as I did in this tutorial, so that you do not accidentally publish your access code. Step 3. Add the save function to the experiment HTML script The Dropbox side work is done. Now, you need to add scripts to send the result file when an experiment session is done. The experiment-with-display-element-save-dropbox.html file in this GitHub repository contains three additional changes from experiment-with-display-element.html . When you open experiment-with-display-element-save-dropbox.html in a browser, you should see the same \"Hello world!\". In addtion, you will find new json and csv files in your Dropbox folder under Apps/<your-app-name> , for example, Apps/SaveMyExperimentData . We start from experiment-with-display-element.html , which you can see from the Hello World! tutorial . Let's look at these additional change. Change 4: Defining necessary variables for saving the results You can set task_name and sbj_id as you like. However, you must provide a correct dropbox_access_token . // experimental session-defining variables var task_name = \"hello-world\"; var sbj_id = \"test01\"; // YOU MUST GET YOUR OWN DROPBOX ACCESS TOKEN var dropbox_access_token = '<PUT YOUR Dropbox ACCESS TOKEN HERE>'; // my preference is to include the task and sbj_id in the file name var save_filename = '/' + task_name + '/' + task_name + '_' + sbj_id; Change 5. Defining save functions using Dropbox API You must load the Dropbox API to use it. <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/4.0.30/Dropbox-sdk.min.js\"></script> You can use either the JSON or CSV format, whichever convenient for you. The save functions look like this. /* Change 5: Defining save functions using Dropbox API */ function save_data_json() { try { var dbx = new Dropbox.Dropbox({ fetch: fetch, accessToken: dropbox_access_token }); dbx.filesUpload({ path: save_filename + '.json', mode: 'overwrite', mute: true, contents: jsPsych.data.get().json() }) .then(function (response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function (error) { console.error(error); }); } catch (err) { console.log(\"Save data function failed.\", err); } } function save_data_csv() { try { var dbx = new Dropbox.Dropbox({ accessToken: dropbox_access_token }); dbx.filesUpload({ path: save_filename + '.csv', mode: 'overwrite', mute: true, contents: jsPsych.data.get().csv() }) .then(function (response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function (error) { console.error(error); }); } catch (err) { console.log(\"Save data function failed.\", err); } } Change 6: Sending the results file upon completion The on_finish callback can be declared in the jsPsych.init method. For details, see the original jsPsych tutorial . The callback will trigger once all trials in the experiment have been run, so it is a great place to call save functions. NOTE: Here, both save_data_json() and save_data_csv() were called to show how these can be used. Choose one. jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage', /* Change 6: Sending the results file upon completion */ on_finish: function() { save_data_json(); save_data_csv(); } }) Putting it all together So the experiment-with-display-element-save-dropbox.html code looks like this. This html file should save the result files to your server. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My experiment</title> <!-- Change 5: Defining save functions using Dropbox API --> <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/4.0.30/Dropbox-sdk.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <link href=\"jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> </head> <body> <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> <div id='display_stage_background'></div> <div id='display_stage'></div> </body> <script> /* Change 4: Defining necessary variables for saving the results */ // experimental session-defining variables var task_name = \"hello-world\"; var sbj_id = \"test01\"; // YOU MUST GET YOUR OWN DROPBOX ACCESS TOKEN var dropbox_access_token = '<PUT YOUR Dropbox ACCESS TOKEN HERE>'; // my preference is to include the task and sbj_id in the file name var save_filename = '/' + task_name + '/' + task_name + '_' + sbj_id; /* Change 5: Defining save functions using Dropbox API */ function save_data_json() { try { var dbx = new Dropbox.Dropbox({ accessToken: dropbox_access_token }); dbx.filesUpload({ path: save_filename + '.json', mode: 'overwrite', mute: true, contents: jsPsych.data.get().json() }) .then(function (response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function (error) { console.error(error); }); } catch (err) { console.log(\"Save data function failed.\", err); } } function save_data_csv() { try { var dbx = new Dropbox.Dropbox({ accessToken: dropbox_access_token }); dbx.filesUpload({ path: save_filename + '.csv', mode: 'overwrite', mute: true, contents: jsPsych.data.get().csv() }) .then(function (response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function (error) { console.error(error); }); } catch (err) { console.log(\"Save data function failed.\", err); } } var hello_trial = { type: 'html-keyboard-response', stimulus: 'Hello world!' } /* Change 1: Using `display_element` */ jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage', /* Change 6: Sending the results file upon completion */ on_finish: function () { save_data_json(); save_data_csv(); } }) </script> </html> Step 4. Add Participand ID to Qualtrics Let's log in to Qualtrics. The basics of embedding jsPsych experiment into Qualtrics is explained in the Embedding Hello World! page. However, if you want to save the experiment data elsewhere, you must have the Participant ID so that you can link Qualtrics data and the experiment file later. In Qualtrics, you can keep or assign the participant ID using Embedded Data elements . The below steps will create the Embedded Data called workerId , which will hold the Participant ID. The value of workerId can be set from the Qualtrics survey URL (for details, see Qualtrics.com: Setting values from the Survey URL and Qualtrics.com: Passing information through query string ). However, if workerId is not set, then Qualtrics will automatically generate a random Participant ID, ranging from PID10000 - PID99999, and use this ID to save data. Setting the name of participant ID variable depends on how you recruit your participants (see the Recruiting Participants section). I set its name to be workerId because I have been using Cloudresearch/TurkPrime with Amazon MTurk, and Cloudresearch uses workerId to automatically add Mturk Worker ID . However, other services suggest different field name -- for example, Prolific suggests PROLIFIC_PID -- so please follow the Qualtrics integration guide from the participant recruiting service you are using. Click Survey Flow from the Survey tab Click Add a New Element Here Choose Embedded Data Click Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown and type workerId . WARNING: These fields are case sensitive. The I in Id is capitalized. All other letters are lower case. Click Add Below on this Set Embedded Data block Choose Branch Click Add a Condition Click Question --> choose Embedded Data Type in workerId Click Is Equal to --> choose Is Empty Click Add a New Element Here under the Branch block Choose Embedded Data Click Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown and type workerId . CLick Set a Value Now Type in PID${rand://int/10000:99999} --> This generates a random Participant ID between PID10000 and PID99999. For details, see Qualtrics.com: Assigning Randomized IDs to Respondents . Click Move of the new blocks you created ( Set Embedded Data and Then Branch If ) and move these blocks the top of Survey Flow After these steps, you should see a screen like below. Step 5. Use the save function from Qualtrics The qualtrics-save-dropbox.js file in this GitHub repository contains additional changes from qualtrics.js and experiment-with-display-element-save-dropbox.html and can be direclty copy-pasted into the Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. We start from qualtrics.js , which you can see from the Hello World! tutorial . Let's look at these additional change. Change 6: Loading the Dropbox API Add the Dropbox API library https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/4.0.30/Dropbox-sdk.min.js to requiredResources like below so that Qualtrics loads the Dropbox API. var requiredResources = [ 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/4.0.30/Dropbox-sdk.min.js', // Change 6: Loading the Dropbox API jslib_url + \"jspsych.js\", jslib_url + \"plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\" ]; Change 7: Adding necessary variables and functions for saving the results The below javascript defines necessary variables and functions for saving the results. Importantly, this script will grab the Participant ID from the Embedded Data workerId , using the piped text ${e://Field/workerId} , and put it in the data file name. IMPORTANT: You must also provide a correct dropbox_access_token . // experimental session-defining variables var task_name = \"hello-world\"; var sbj_id = \"${e://Field/workerId}\"; // YOU MUST GET YOUR OWN DROPBOX ACCESS TOKEN var dropbox_access_token = '<PUT YOUR Dropbox ACCESS TOKEN HERE>'; // my preference is to include the task and sbj_id in the file name var save_filename = '/' + task_name + '/' + task_name + '_' + sbj_id; function save_data_json() { try { var dbx = new Dropbox.Dropbox({ accessToken: dropbox_access_token }); dbx.filesUpload({ path: save_filename + '.json', mode: 'overwrite', mute: true, contents: jsPsych.data.get().json() }) .then(function (response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function (error) { console.error(error); }); } catch (err) { console.log(\"Save data function failed.\", err); } } function save_data_csv() { try { var dbx = new Dropbox.Dropbox({ accessToken: dropbox_access_token }); dbx.filesUpload({ path: save_filename + '.csv', mode: 'overwrite', mute: true, contents: jsPsych.data.get().csv() }) .then(function (response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function (error) { console.error(error); }); } catch (err) { console.log(\"Save data function failed.\", err); } } Change 8: Calling the save function -- CHOOSE ONE! The save function was added inside on_finish , which is called once all trials in the experiment have been run. The participant ID, sbj_id , was added to the data itself, so that you can match the data file even when the file name is changed. NOTE: Here, both save_data_json() and save_data_csv() were called to show how these can be used. Choose one. jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage', /* Change 5: Adding the clean up and continue functions.*/ on_finish: function (data) { /* Change 8: Calling the save function -- CHOOSE ONE! */ // include the participant ID in the data // this must be done before saving jsPsych.data.get().addToLast({participant: sbj_id}); save_data_json(); save_data_csv(); // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); } }); Putting it all together So the qualtrics-save-dropbox.js code looks like this.

So it is safe to delete the app after your data collection is done. However, the saved files in your Dropbox folder remains intact, so you don't need to worry. Deleting the app is very simple.

The basics of embedding jsPsych experiment into Qualtrics is explained in the Embedding Hello World! page. However, if you want to save the experiment data elsewhere, you must have the Participant ID so that you can link Qualtrics data and the experiment file later. In Qualtrics, you can keep or assign the participant ID using Embedded Data elements . The below steps will create the Embedded Data called workerId , which will hold the Participant ID. The value of workerId can be set from the Qualtrics survey URL (for details, see Qualtrics.com: Setting values from the Survey URL and Qualtrics.com: Passing information through query string ). However, if workerId is not set, then Qualtrics will automatically generate a random Participant ID, ranging from PID10000 - PID99999, and use this ID to save data. Setting the name of participant ID variable depends on how you recruit your participants (see the Recruiting Participants section). I set its name to be workerId because I have been using Cloudresearch/TurkPrime with Amazon MTurk, and Cloudresearch uses workerId to automatically add Mturk Worker ID . However, other services suggest different field name -- for example, Prolific suggests PROLIFIC_PID -- so please follow the Qualtrics integration guide from the participant recruiting service you are using.

If you have access to a web server that can run PHP , then you can save each participant's data as a CSV or JSON file on the server. Step 0. Get access to a web server Your institution usually provides you a free access to a web server, so that you can run your personal web site. If you are not familiar with web servers and PHP, please please ask your IT professional for help. They almost always can HELP you! Also look for resources like below. UNL.edu: Prerequisites for hosting web content on your account/setting up your first PHP page NJIT.edu: Step by step instructions for beginners for creating a basic Web Page Step 1. Go into the public_html directory If you have gained the access to a web server, login to the server and go to the public_html directory. If you are not sure, please read this page first: Prerequisites for hosting web content on your account/how to setup your first PHP page . Reading this linux command cheatsheet can also help. $ cd ~/public_html Step 2. Set up the directories for saving experiment files Let's create a directory called exp_data , which will host necessary files and serve as a parent directory for your experiments by running three separate commands one-by-one. This command makes a directory called exp_data : $ mkdir exp_data This command moves you into the exp_data directory: $ cd exp_data This command shows you where you are. So you should see something like /home/<your-account>/public_html/exp_data : $ pwd This command prevents others from seeing inside exp_data by creating an empty index html file: $ touch index.html This command makes sure that index.html hides the directory structure (for details of .htaccess , see http://www.htaccess-guide.com/directoryindex-uses/ ) $ echo \"DirectoryIndex index.html\" >> .htaccess Step 3. Create the save_data.php Let's create the PHP file that will receive and save your data by using vi . If you are not familiar with vi , please read this guide for using the vi editor . This command will open an vi editor and let you edit it: $ vi save_data.php Copy-paste the below PHP code and save, then you are done with this step: <?php // WARNING: the below config can cause a serious security issue. // Please read https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/access-control-allow-origin // Once you are done testing, you should limit the access //header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://ssd.az1.qualtrics.com'); header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); // NOTE: the below code expects three fields and will NOT work if any of these is missing. // - data_dir: specify the server directory to store data // - file_name: specify the filename of the data being saved, which can include subject id // - exp_data: contain the full json/csv data to be saved if (isset($_POST['exp_data']) == false) { echo('Hello'); exit; } $exp_data = $_POST['exp_data']; /* prevent XSS: */ $_POST = filter_input_array(INPUT_POST, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING); if (isset($_POST['data_dir']) == true) { $data_dir = $_POST['data_dir']; // data directory } else { exit; } if (isset($_POST['file_name']) == true) { $file_name = $_POST['file_name']; // mturk_id } else { exit; } // write the file to disk // NOTE: you must make the data directory by all users // For example, by running `chmod 772` to give a write access to EVERYONE file_put_contents($data_dir.'/'.$file_name, $exp_data); exit; ?> Your save_data.php url will look like https://<server-url>/~<your-account>/exp_data/save_data.php , like my url -- https://users.rcc.uchicago.edu/~kywch/exp_data/save_data.php . Note that the exp_data/save_data.php part should be the same if you followed the above steps. If your script is running, you will see Hello in your browser. Step 4. Make an experiment directory The above PHP script requires the experimenter to specify data_dir , in which experiment files are saved. Here, let's create a folder called hello-world under exp_data and save files there. Make sure that you are in the exp_data folder with pwd . This command makes a directory called hello-world : $ mkdir hello-world You also need to adjust this directory's permission so that the PHP script can save files. To learn more about permissions, see this page: http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php . This command allows the PHP script to write files in the hello-world directory, while preventing other people from seeing inside: $ chmod 772 hello-world Step 5. Add the save function to the experiment HTML script The server side work is done. Now, you need to add scripts to send the result file when an experiment session is done. The experiment-with-display-element-save-php.html file in this GitHub repository contains three additional changes from experiment-with-display-element.html . When you open experiment-with-display-element-save-php.html in a browser, you should see the same \"Hello world!\". In addtion, you will find new json and csv files under hello-world when you put correct url of save_data.php below. We start from experiment-with-display-element.html , which you can see from the Hello World! tutorial . Let's look at these additional change. Change 4: Defining necessary variables for saving the results The above save_data.php expects three fields -- data_dir , file_name , and exp_data -- and will NOT work if any of these is missing. data_dir specifies the server directory to store data. You may want to include task_name in the directory name. file_name specifies the filename of the result file. You may want to include the subject id. exp_data contains the full json/csv data to be saved. You need to replace save_url with your save_data.php url. // experimental session-defining variables var task_name = \"hello-world\"; var sbj_id = \"test01\"; // you must put your save_data php url here. var save_url = \"https://users.rcc.uchicago.edu/~kywch/exp_data/save_data.php\"; var data_dir = task_name; // my preference is to include the task and sbj_id in the file name var file_name = task_name + '_' + sbj_id; Change 5. Defining save functions using jQuery Qualtrics loads jQuery by default, so you can use jQuery for saving files. However, this html script must load jQuery library to use the save function. <script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js'></script> You can use either the JSON or CSV format, whichever convenient for you. The save functions look like this. function save_data_json() { jQuery.ajax({ type: 'post', cache: false, url: save_url, data: { data_dir: data_dir, file_name: file_name + '.json', // the file type should be added exp_data: jsPsych.data.get().json() } }); } function save_data_csv() { jQuery.ajax({ type: 'post', cache: false, url: save_url, data: { data_dir: data_dir, file_name: file_name + '.csv', // the file type should be added exp_data: jsPsych.data.get().csv() } }); } Change 6: Sending the results file upon completion The on_finish callback can be declared in the jsPsych.init method. For details, see the original jsPsych tutorial . The callback will trigger once all trials in the experiment have been run, so it is a great place to call save functions. NOTE: Here, both save_data_json() and save_data_csv() were called to show how these can be used. Choose one. jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage', /* Change 6: Sending the results file upon completion */ on_finish: function() { save_data_json(); save_data_csv(); } }) Putting it all together So the experiment-with-display-element-save-php.html code looks like this. This html file should save the result files to your server. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My experiment</title> <!-- Change 5: Defining save functions using jQuery --> <script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js'></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js\"></script> <script src=\"jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\"></script> <link href=\"jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> </head> <body> <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> <div id='display_stage_background'></div> <div id='display_stage'></div> </body> <script> /* Change 4: Defining necessary variables for saving the results */ // experimental session-defining variables var task_name = \"hello-world\"; var sbj_id = \"test01\"; // you must put your save_data php url here. var save_url = \"https://users.rcc.uchicago.edu/~kywch/exp_data/save_data.php\"; var data_dir = task_name; // my preference is to include the task and sbj_id in the file name var file_name = task_name + '_' + sbj_id; /* Change 5: Defining save functions using jQuery */ function save_data_json() { jQuery.ajax({ type: 'post', cache: false, url: save_url, data: { data_dir: data_dir, file_name: file_name + '.json', // the file type should be added exp_data: jsPsych.data.get().json() } }); } function save_data_csv() { jQuery.ajax({ type: 'post', cache: false, url: save_url, data: { data_dir: data_dir, file_name: file_name + '.csv', // the file type should be added exp_data: jsPsych.data.get().csv() } }); } var hello_trial = { type: 'html-keyboard-response', stimulus: 'Hello world!' } /* Change 1: Using `display_element` */ jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage', /* Change 6: Sending the results file upon completion */ on_finish: function() { save_data_json(); save_data_csv(); } }) </script> </html> Step 6. Add Participand ID to Qualtrics Let's log in to Qualtrics. The basics of embedding jsPsych experiment into Qualtrics is explained in the Embedding Hello World! page. However, if you want to save the experiment data elsewhere, you must have the Participant ID so that you can link Qualtrics data and the experiment file later. In Qualtrics, you can keep or assign the participant ID using Embedded Data elements . The below steps will create the Embedded Data called workerId , which will hold the Participant ID. The value of workerId can be set from the Qualtrics survey URL (for details, see Qualtrics.com: Setting values from the Survey URL and Qualtrics.com: Passing information through query string ). However, if workerId is not set, then Qualtrics will automatically generate a random Participant ID, ranging from PID10000 - PID99999, and use this ID to save data. Setting the name of participant ID variable depends on how you recruit your participants (see the Recruiting Participants section). I set its name to be workerId because I have been using Cloudresearch/TurkPrime with Amazon MTurk, and Cloudresearch uses workerId to automatically add Mturk Worker ID . However, other services suggest different field name -- for example, Prolific suggests PROLIFIC_PID -- so please follow the Qualtrics integration guide from the participant recruiting service you are using. Click Survey Flow from the Survey tab Click Add a New Element Here Choose Embedded Data Click Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown and type workerId . WARNING: These fields are case sensitive. The I in Id is capitalized. All other letters are lower case. Click Add Below on this Set Embedded Data block Choose Branch Click Add a Condition Click Question --> choose Embedded Data Type in workerId Click Is Equal to --> choose Is Empty Click Add a New Element Here under the Branch block Choose Embedded Data Click Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown and type workerId . CLick Set a Value Now Type in PID${rand://int/10000:99999} --> This generates a random Participant ID between PID10000 and PID99999. For details, see Qualtrics.com: Assigning Randomized IDs to Respondents . Click Move of the new blocks you created ( Set Embedded Data and Then Branch If ) and move these blocks the top of Survey Flow After these steps, you should see a screen like below. Step 7. Use the save function from Qualtrics The qualtrics-save-php.js file in this GitHub repository contains additional changes from qualtrics.js and experiment-with-display-element-save-php.html and can be direclty copy-pasted into the Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. We start from qualtrics.js , which you can see from the Hello World! tutorial . Let's look at these additional change. Change 6: Defining necessary variables and functions for saving the results The below javascript defines necessary variables and functions for saving the results. Importantly, this script will grab the Participant ID from the Embedded Data workerId , using the piped text ${e://Field/workerId} , and put it in the data file name. The above save_data.php expects three fields -- data_dir , file_name , and exp_data -- and will NOT work if any of these is missing. data_dir specifies the server directory to store data. You may want to include task_name in the directory name. file_name specifies the filename of the data being saved. exp_data contains the full json/csv data to be saved. You need to replace save_url with your save_data.php url. // experimental session-defining variables var task_name = \"hello-world\"; var sbj_id = \"${e://Field/workerId}\"; // you must put your save_data php url here. var save_url = \"https://users.rcc.uchicago.edu/~kywch/exp_data/save_data.php\"; var data_dir = task_name; // my preference is to include the task and sbj_id in the file name var file_name = task_name + '_' + sbj_id; function save_data_json() { jQuery.ajax({ type: 'post', cache: false, url: save_url, data: { data_dir: data_dir, file_name: file_name + '.json', // the file type should be added exp_data: jsPsych.data.get().json() } }); } function save_data_csv() { jQuery.ajax({ type: 'post', cache: false, url: save_url, data: { data_dir: data_dir, file_name: file_name + '.csv', // the file type should be added exp_data: jsPsych.data.get().csv() } }); } Change 7: Calling the save function -- CHOOSE ONE! The save function was added inside on_finish , which is called once all trials in the experiment have been run. The participant ID, sbj_id , was added to the data itself, so that you can match the data file even when the file name is changed. NOTE: Here, both save_data_json() and save_data_csv() were called to show how these can be used. Choose one. jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage', /* Change 5: Add the clean up and continue functions.*/ on_finish: function (data) { /* Change 7: Calling the save function -- CHOOSE ONE! */ // include the participant ID in the data // this must be done before saving jsPsych.data.get().addToLast({participant: sbj_id}); save_data_json(); save_data_csv(); // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); } }); Putting it all together So the qualtrics-save-php.js code looks like this. Embed this script in Qualtrics by following these steps and see whether your save function works. Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function () { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page loads*/ /* Change 1: Hiding the Next button */ // Retrieve Qualtrics object and save in qthis var qthis = this; // Hide buttons qthis.hideNextButton(); /* Change 2: Defining and load required resources */ var jslib_url = \"https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/\"; // the below urls must be accessible with your browser // for example, https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych/jspsych.js var requiredResources = [ jslib_url + \"jspsych.js\", jslib_url + \"plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\" ]; function loadScript(idx) { console.log(\"Loading \", requiredResources[idx]); jQuery.getScript(requiredResources[idx], function () { if ((idx + 1) < requiredResources.length) { loadScript(idx + 1); } else { initExp(); } }); } if (window.Qualtrics && (!window.frameElement || window.frameElement.id !== \"mobile-preview-view\")) { loadScript(0); } /* Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery */ // jQuery is loaded in Qualtrics by default jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage_background'></div>\").appendTo('body'); jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage'></div>\").appendTo('body'); /* Change 6: Defining necessary variables and functions for saving the results */ // experimental session-defining variables var task_name = \"hello-world\"; var sbj_id = \"${e://Field/workerId}\"; // you must put your save_data php url here. var save_url = \"https://users.rcc.uchicago.edu/~kywch/exp_data/save_data.php\"; var data_dir = task_name; // my preference is to include the task and sbj_id in the file name var file_name = task_name + '_' + sbj_id; function save_data_json() { jQuery.ajax({ type: 'post', cache: false, url: save_url, data: { data_dir: data_dir, file_name: file_name + '.json', // the file type should be added exp_data: jsPsych.data.get().json() } }); } function save_data_csv() { jQuery.ajax({ type: 'post', cache: false, url: save_url, data: { data_dir: data_dir, file_name: file_name + '.csv', // the file type should be added exp_data: jsPsych.data.get().csv() } }); } /* Change 4: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function */ function initExp() { var hello_trial = { type: 'html-keyboard-response', stimulus: 'Hello world!' } jsPsych.init({ timeline: [hello_trial], display_element: 'display_stage', /* Change 5: Adding the clean up and continue functions.*/ on_finish: function (data) { /* Change 7: Calling the save function -- CHOOSE ONE! */ // include the participant ID in the data // this must be done before saving jsPsych.data.get().addToLast({participant: sbj_id}); save_data_json(); save_data_csv(); // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); } }); } }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function () { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is fully displayed*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function () { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is unloaded*/ }); Step 8. Download the data When your experiment is done, you can easily download the result files with the following steps. First, log in to your account. Then, this command takes you to the exp_data that you made. $ cd ~/public_html/exp_data This command compresses the directory with the result files (in this case hello-world ). You need to replace hello-world with your own experiment/directory. $ zip -r hello-world.zip hello-world You can access the zipped file through your web-browser by going to https://<server-url>/~<your-account>/exp_data/hello-world.zip , like my url -- https://users.rcc.uchicago.edu/~kywch/exp_data/hello-world.zip .

So, it'd be easier for you to fork my STOP-IT repository and start from there. This version of the Stop Signal Task needs to save the trial-by-trial data for analysis, so I will save the data file to Dropbox. Verbruggen et al. (2019) also provided the analysis script , so please have a look. This tutorial consists of two parts. (1) I will first explain how you can embed the Stop Signal Task in Qualtrics . (2) I will then explain the changes I made to the original experiment code . Embedding the STOP-IT Stop Signal Task into Qualtrics Hosting the STOP-IT scripts in GitHub To use jsPsych in Qualtrics, the jsPsych javascript and CSS files need to be online and loadable from Qualtrics. Creating a GitHub repository for your experiment helps you do so in simple steps. Go to the my STOP-IT repository . Follow the Hosting jsPsych tutorial to fork it to your GitHub repository and make the scripts available online. When you are done, you can check the online files with your browser by directly going to the jspsych.js , jspsych.css , jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js , and stop-it_main.js . jspsych.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/js/jspsych-6.0.5/jspsych.js , like https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/js/jspsych-6.0.5/jspsych.js . jspsych.css should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/js/jspsych-6.0.5/css/jspsych.css , like https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/js/jspsych-6.0.5/css/jspsych.css . jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/js/jspsych-6.0.5/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js , like https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/js/jspsych-6.0.5/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js . stop-it_main.js should be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/stop-it_main.js , like https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/stop-it_main.js . Preparing the Dropbox to save your files To analyze the Stop Signal Task data, you need the trial-by-trial data file. You can save the data file to using a web server and PHP , but in this tutorial, I save the data file to Dropbox. Please see the tutorial Saving Data to your Dropbox and get the Dropbox access token . Also, please take a moment to look at the save function and some things to put in Qualtrics, which are already built into experiment-transformed-qualtrics.js . For the save function to work properly, you must put your Dropbox access token to the dropbox_access_token variable, where I marked with the string <PUT YOUR Dropbox ACCESS TOKEN HERE> . Please replace this string with your Dropbox access token. Embedding the task to Qualtrics Let's log in to Qualtrics and take a look at each step. Step 1. Create a new Qualtrics project and then a new question This tutorial assumes that readers are much more familiar with Qualtrics. For Qualtrics tutorial, there are other excellent tutorials available like this Qualtrics User Guide . To continue, please create a new Qualtrics project. Then, create a new question and (1) change its format to Text/Graphic . Step 2. Open the Question JavaScript editor and copy paste the whole experiment-transformed-qualtrics.js Keep going in the above picture. (2) Click the gear to open the dropdown menu, and then (3) find and click Add JavaScript . Then copy-paste the whole experiment-transformed-qualtrics.js (click to see the code) into the editor. DO NOT FORGET TO PUT THE DROPBOX ACCESS TOKEN INTO THE CODE. Step 3. Open the Question HTML editor and copy paste the below html code The Change 3 section of the experiment-transformed-third.html file contains the link to jsPsych CSS file, the inline styles for display_stage Div, and the error message to be displayed when things go wrong. To open the HTML editor, click the HTML View button. Then, copy paste the portion of experiment-transformed-third.html to the HTML editor, starting from <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> to <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> . <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/js/jspsych-6.0.5/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> After copy pasting, you should see something like below. Step 4. Create Embedded Data elements To store the experiment results with the participant's ID, you need to create the Embedded Data elements named workerId in your survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Why do I use the name workerId ? For an answer, please read the Recruiting Participants section. Click Survey Flow from the Survey tab Click Add a New Element Here Choose Embedded Data Click Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown and type workerId Click Move of the new blocks you created ( Set Embedded Data and Then Branch If ) and move these blocks the top of Survey Flow Step 5. Publish and test! Publish the survey by following this Qualtrics tutorial . Then, an anonymous Qualtrics link is generated. If you click this link, you should be able to see the same STOP-IT Stop Signal Task running in Qualtrics. For example, try this Qualtrics link . DOUBLE CHECK WHETHER THE TRIAL-BY-TRIAL DATA IS SAVED TO YOUR DROPBOX. Explaining the code changes Using the GitHub-hosted images: configuration/experiment_variables.js The original STOP-IT task uses the stimuli images in the images folder placed with the experiment html. But since these images are available online once you enable your GitHub Pages, you can use these images. For example, the images/fix.png is available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/jsPsych_version/images/fix.png . For example, https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/images/fix.png . So, I modifed the fix_stim , go_stim1 , go_stim2 , stop_stim1 , and stop_stim2 variables in the configuration/experiment_variables.js by adding the repo_site variable like below. // define the site that hosts stimuli images // usually https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name>/ var repo_site = 'https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/'; // locate the stimuli that will be used in the experiment var fix_stim = repo_site + 'images/fix.png'; var go_stim1 = repo_site + 'images/go_left.png'; var go_stim2 = repo_site + 'images/go_right.png'; var stop_stim1 = repo_site + 'images/stop_left.png'; var stop_stim2 = repo_site + 'images/stop_right.png'; Please compare the original experiment_variables.js (click to see the code) vs. the modified experiment_variables.js (click the see the code) . First transformation: experiment-transformed-first.html and stop-it_main.js I prefer to separate out the experiment-related code from the operation-related code, following the Experiment Factory style. If you haven't, please visit the Experiment Factory library , which contain a ton of experiments with running demos and their code. In the experiment.html (click to see the code) , defining the components that go into the timeline can be considered to be experiment-related, and the remaining parts that also appear in the Hello-World example , such as loading jspsych.js and jsPsych.init() can be considered to be operation-related. So, I separated the experiment-related code and the operation-related code and putting the code into stop-it_main.js (click to see the code) and experiment-transformed-first.html (click to see the code) , respectively. In addition, the original STOP-IT code includes the consent, participant_id, gender pages, etc, but these pages can be better handled by Qualtrics. So, I took these pages out and isolated the stop signal task. Please take a moment to look at the stop-it_main.js (click to see the code) and experiment-transformed-first.html (click to see the code) files and compare these to the original experiment.html (click to see the code) . Double click both experiment.html and experiment-transformed-first.html in your local folder and see if these work well. Second transformation (display_element): experiment-transformed-second.html Adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() and having additional control over the display element is important for embedding jsPsych into Qualtrics. The experiment-transformed-second.html (click to see the code) contains three changes from the experiment-transformed-first.html (click to see the code) . When you open experiment-transformed-second.html in a browser, you should see the same Stop Signal Task. Let's look at each change. Change 1: Using display_element By adding the display_element parameter in the jsPsych.init() like below, jsPsych will render the experiment in the <div> called display_stage , which the current script does not have yet. So, let's add the display_stage . // run the experiment! jsPsych.init({ /* Change 1: Using `display_element` */ display_element: 'display_stage', timeline: timeline, preload_images: [fix_stim, go_stim1, go_stim2, stop_stim1, stop_stim2], Change 2: Adding display_stage CSS and Div The display_stage needs below CSS and HTML code after the <body> tag, which also include the display_stage_background . Both are necessary to function well. <!-- Change 2: Adding `display_stage` CSS and Div --> <style> #display_stage_background { width: 100vw; background-color: white; z-index: -1; } #display_stage { position: fixed; left: 1vw; top: 1vh; height: 98vh; width: 98vw; background-color: white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #999; border-radius: 15px; z-index: 0; overflow-y: hidden; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS UP TO HERE --> <div id='display_stage_background'></div> <div id='display_stage'></div> Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics The below scripts are not necessary to run this task, but you need to copy-paste these in Qualtrics later. One critical point is that now we use the jsPsych stylesheet hosted in the GitHub Pages (explained above in the Hosting jsPsych section) instead of the CSS file in your computer. This is important because Qualtrics can also access the GitHub-hosted files. <!-- Change 3: Adding extra scripts for Qualtrics --> <!-- COPY PASTE TO QUALTRICS FROM HERE --> <link href=\"https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/js/jspsych-6.0.5/css/jspsych.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </link> <div> <span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"> <br><br> If you are seeing this message for <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><b>more than 5 minutes</b></span>,<br> please screen-capture this screen and send the image to us. <br><br> <span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">We are very sorry for the inconvenience.</span> </span> </div> Third transformation (save to Dropbox): experiment-transformed-third.html To make experiment-transformed-third.html (click to see the code) work and save the trial-by-trial data file, you should set up your Dropbox App and get your Dropbox access token . To do so, see the above instructions . The experiment-transformed-third.html (click to see the code) contains three additional changes from experiment-transformed-second.html (click to see the code) . Let's look at these additional change. Change 4: Defining necessary variables for saving the results You can set task_id , sbj_id , and save_filename as you like. However, you must provide a correct dropbox_access_token . /* Change 4: Defining necessary variables for saving the results */ // experimental session-defining variables var task_id = \"STOP-IT\"; var sbj_id = \"test01\"; // YOU MUST GET YOUR OWN DROPBOX ACCESS TOKEN var dropbox_access_token = '<PUT YOUR Dropbox ACCESS TOKEN HERE>'; // my preference is to include the task and sbj_id in the file name var save_filename = '/' + task_id + '/' + task_id + '_' + sbj_id + '.csv'; Change 5. Defining save functions using Dropbox API You must load the Dropbox API to use it. <!-- Change 5: Defining save functions using Dropbox API --> <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/4.0.30/Dropbox-sdk.min.js\"></script> The below save function is also added. /* Change 5: Defining save functions using Dropbox API */ function save_data(dropbox_access_token, save_filename) { console.log(\"Save data function called.\"); var selected_data = filter_data(); try { var dbx = new Dropbox.Dropbox({ fetch: fetch, accessToken: dropbox_access_token }); dbx.filesUpload({ path: save_filename, mode: 'overwrite', mute: true, contents: selected_data.csv() }) .then(function (response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function (error) { console.error(error); }); } catch (err) { console.log(\"Save data function failed.\", err); } Change 6: Sending the results file upon completion The on_finish callback can be declared in the jsPsych.init method. For details, see the original jsPsych tutorial . The callback will trigger once all trials in the experiment have been run, so it is a great place to call save functions. /* Change 6: Sending the results file upon completion */ on_finish: function () { save_data(dropbox_access_token, save_filename); }, Fourth transformation: experiment-transformed-qualtrics.js To make your jsPsych experiment work in Qualtrics, you need to add your code to the below skeleton provided by Qualtrics Question JavaScript Editor. For details, see the Add JavaScript help page . Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page loads*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is fully displayed*/ }); Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function() { /*Place your JavaScript here to run when the page is unloaded*/ }); Let's look at each change. Change 1: Hiding the Next button The below javascript code hides the Next button and puts the javascript code in the driving seat. /* Change 1: Hiding the Next button */ // Retrieve Qualtrics object and save in qthis var qthis = this; // Hide buttons qthis.hideNextButton(); Change 2: Defining and load required resources The below javascript defines where the necessary files are so that Qualtrics can load these. If you enabled GitHub Pages of your repository, Qualtrics can load the necessary JS, CSS, and image files right away. /* Change 2: Defining and load required resources */ var task_github = \"https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/\"; // https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-experiment-name> // requiredResources must include all the JS files that demo-simple-rt-task-transformed.html uses. var requiredResources = [ \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/4.0.30/Dropbox-sdk.min.js\", task_github + \"js/jspsych-6.0.5/jspsych.js\", task_github + \"js/jspsych-6.0.5/plugins/jspsych-instructions.js\", task_github + \"js/jspsych-6.0.5/plugins/jspsych-fullscreen.js\", task_github + \"js/jspsych-6.0.5/plugins/jspsych-call-function.js\", task_github + \"js/jspsych-6.0.5/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js\", task_github + \"js/jspsych-detect-held-down-keys.js\", task_github + \"js/custom-stop-signal-plugin.js\", task_github + \"js/sprintf.js\", task_github + \"configuration/experiment_variables.js\", task_github + \"configuration/text_variables.js\", task_github + \"stop-it_main.js\" ]; function loadScript(idx) { console.log(\"Loading \", requiredResources[idx]); jQuery.getScript(requiredResources[idx], function () { if ((idx + 1) < requiredResources.length) { loadScript(idx + 1); } else { initExp(); } }); } if (window.Qualtrics && (!window.frameElement || window.frameElement.id !== \"mobile-preview-view\")) { loadScript(0); } Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery In Qualtrics, jQuery (loaded by default) is used to append the display_stage_background and display_stage Divs. The CSS for these elements will be added directly to Question HTML later in this tutorial. /* Change 3: Appending the display_stage Div using jQuery */ // jQuery is loaded in Qualtrics by default jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage_background'></div>\").appendTo('body'); jQuery(\"<div id = 'display_stage'></div>\").appendTo('body'); Change 4: Adding save and helper functions /* Change 4: Adding save and helper functions */ function filter_data() { var ignore_columns = ['raw_rt', 'trial_type', 'first_stimulus', 'second_stimulus', 'onset_of_first_stimulus', 'onset_of_second_stimulus', 'key_press', 'correct_response', 'trial_index', 'internal_node_id' ]; var rows = { trial_type: 'custom-stop-signal-plugin' }; // we are only interested in our main stimulus, not fixation, feedback etc. var selected_data = jsPsych.data.get().filter(rows).ignore(ignore_columns); // the next piece of codes orders the columns of the data file var d = selected_data.values() // get the data values // make an array that specifies the order of the object properties var arr = ['block_i', 'trial_i', 'stim', 'signal', 'SSD', 'response', 'rt', 'correct', 'focus', 'Fullscreen', 'time_elapsed', 'window_resolution' ]; new_arr = [] // we will fill this array with the ordered data function myFunction(item) { // this is function is called in the arr.forEach call below new_obj[item] = obj[item] return new_obj } // do it for the whole data array for (i = 0; i < d.length; i++) { obj = d[i]; // get one row of data new_obj = {}; arr.forEach(myFunction) // for each element in the array run my function selected_data.values()[i] = new_obj; // insert the ordered values back in the jsPsych.data object } return selected_data; } function save_data(dropbox_access_token, save_filename) { console.log(\"Save data function called.\"); var selected_data = filter_data(); try { var dbx = new Dropbox.Dropbox({ fetch: fetch, accessToken: dropbox_access_token }); dbx.filesUpload({ path: save_filename, mode: 'overwrite', mute: true, contents: selected_data.csv() }) .then(function (response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function (error) { console.error(error); }); } catch (err) { console.log(\"Save data function failed.\", err); } } Change 5: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function The main experiment codes are wrapped in the initExp function to make sure it runs after all the necessary library and plugin files are loaded (as defined in the loadScript function above). Please look carefully at the variable sbj_id . It first looks at Qualtrics' embedded data workerId . If it's empty, then the code generates a random sequence and use it as sbj_id so that the saved data file is almost always unique. /* Change 5: Wrapping jsPsych.init() in a function */ function initExp() { // experimental session-defining variables flag_debug = true; task_id = \"STOP-IT\"; sbj_id = \"${e://Field/workerId}\"; if (!sbj_id.trim()) { sbj_id = Math.random().toString(36).slice(-6); try { Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"workerId\", sbj_id); } catch (err) { console.log('Warning: ', err); } } // my preference is to include the task id/name and sbj_id in the file name var save_filename = '/' + task_id + '/' + task_id + '_' + sbj_id + '.csv'; // YOU MUST GET YOUR OWN DROPBOX ACCESS TOKEN to save the file var dropbox_access_token = '<PUT YOUR Dropbox ACCESS TOKEN HERE>'; // push all the procedures, which are defined in stop-it_main.js to the overall timeline var timeline = []; // this array stores the events we want to run in the experiment timeline.push(start_procedure, block_procedure, end_procedure); jsPsych.init({ display_element: 'display_stage', timeline: timeline, preload_images: [fix_stim, go_stim1, go_stim2, stop_stim1, stop_stim2], // ... omitted } }); Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions When the jsPsych ends, display_stage and display_stage_background should be removed. Then, the script executes the clickNextButton to simulate clicking the Next button and proceed to the next question. on_finish: function () { save_data(dropbox_access_token, save_filename); /* Change 6: Adding the clean up and continue functions.*/ // clear the stage jQuery('display_stage').remove(); jQuery('display_stage_background').remove(); // simulate click on Qualtrics \"next\" button, making use of the Qualtrics JS API qthis.clickNextButton(); }","title":"Embedding Stop Signal Task (STOP-IT)"},{"location":"stop-it/#embedding-the-stop-it-stop-signal-task-into-qualtrics","text":"Let's embed the Stop Signal Task by Verbruggen et al., 2019 , the jsPsych_version into Qualtrics.
